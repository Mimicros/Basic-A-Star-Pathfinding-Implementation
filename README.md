This is a basic implementation of A* pathfinding algorithm. For the algorithm to work, 
the h value, that is, the distance to the target node, the g value, the distance to the starting node, 
and finally the f value, that is, the sum of the g and h values, must be defined for 
each neighbour node until it reaches the target node. When the searching part ends, 
algorithm will retrace the path from the end to start node and finds the shortest path.
